ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Matteo Boffa, a PhD student at Politecnico di Torino and a member of the [SmartData group](https://smartdata.polito.it/members/matteo-boffa/). 
As a Machine and Deep Learning enthusiast, in my research, I investigate the adoption of Natural Language Processing (NLP) in cybersecurity.

You can find more details in the following papers:
- [Towards NLP-based processing of honeypot logs](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9799396): Leveraging NLP-based techniques to represent attacking sessions. Instrumental tool for the security experts. The paper was presented at WTMC, a workshop co-located with the IEEE European Symposium on Security and Privacy.
- [On using pretext tasks to learn representations from network logs](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3565009.3569522): Assessing network logsâ€™ learned representation through auxiliary (pretext) tasks. Unsupervised application on logs collected from SSH honeypots. The paper was presented at NativeNI, a workshop co-located with ACM CoNEXT 2022.
- [LogPrÃ©cis: Unleashing language models for automated malicious log analysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167404824001068): Leveraging Language Models (e.g., BERT, CodeBERT, GPT) for a tool that supports the analysts better understanding attacks, detecting novelty, linking similar attacks and tracking families and mutations. Named Entity Recognition and Entity Extraction. Published on Computer & Security (COSE).

I have also worked on optimization problems, data mining, and analysis in my studies. For more information, please refer to:
- [Neural combinatorial optimization beyond the TSP: Existing architectures under-represent graph structure](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0264275123000744): Graph Neural Network applied to network combinatorial problems (power and channel allocation) on a Reinforcement Learning framework. Results in the field of Representation Learning. Presented at GCLR, a workshop co-located with AAAI
- [The polynomial robust knapsack problem](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0264275123000744): Operational research. Exact solution, Machine Learning and Genetic algorithms heuristics. Solves a portfolio optimization. > 5% margin from optimum. Published on EJOR - European Journal of Operational Research (Elsevier).
- [Automatic identification of urban functions via social mining](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0264275123000744): Exploiting geo-referenced data from Social Networks for automatic characterization of urban functions. Data mining, clustering algorithms and transfer learning (e.g., InceptionV3). Published on Cities - The International Journal of Urban Policy and Planning (Elsevier).
