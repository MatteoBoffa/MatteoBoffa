ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @MatteoBoffa, a Master Degree Engineering student at Politecnico di Torino and Machine Learning Analysts. 

My academic path so far has provided me a solid background in big-data applications, databases and machine learning. 
Particularly, I've had the opportunity of practically apply my theoretical knowledges with real-world examples in the Smart-City framework.

What I'm currently into are Graph Neural Networks applied to combinatorial problems: in that field, obtaining meaningful and machine-understandable embeddings of the graph's elements is a vital and arduos task.
The latest state-of-art techniques in the field has been mostly applied to a restrict subset such as the TSP and its variants: it is therefore not clear whether and how efficiently they can be transfered to different problems.

Machine Learning promises automation: at its best, without needing domain-experts or tailored solutions, it can generalize beyond the problem's tipology and numerosity. 
Even if currently far from this achievement, the revolutionary advantages this would bring are, in my opinion, worth the time and effort of researchers.   

Don't esitate to contact me on my [personal email](mailto:boffa.matteo.97@gmail.com) or [linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matteo-boffa-414a72206)!
